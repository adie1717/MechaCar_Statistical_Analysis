# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
**Lesson 15- MechaCarStatistical_Analysis**

The variables that provided a non random amount of variance the mpg values are; vehicle weight and awd. 

The linear model is closer to 1 with an R-value of .71 and also, there are several variables (mpg, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD) taken into account to predicting the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes. 

In general, the larger the R-squared value, the more precisely the predictor variables are able to predict the value of the response variable.
